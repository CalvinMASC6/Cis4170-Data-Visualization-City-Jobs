# Cis4170-Data-Visualization-City-Jobs
This project was done for my data Visualization course.

The code produces assistant visuals for a discussion on the recruitment process, including application requirements, residency requirements, and any preferred skills or qualifications for city jobs.

This was a live presented assignment so there is no script to attach that would enhance understandability.

If you wish to use the code just be aware of the license attached.
